## Donations

The blog software allows you to integrate via different micro-transaction services. The following chapter will show you how to set up donations.

### Ko-fi

You can use [Ko-fi](https://Ko-fi.com/) as a payment service to receive donations. To acquire the `KofiToken` as seen in the config above, head to [widgets page](https://Ko-fi.com/manage/widgets), click on "Ko-fi Button".
Now choose "Image" as the type. In the field below under `Copy & Paste Code` you see an `<a href='https://ko-fi.com/XYZ'` tag. Just take the `XYZ` part and put it into `KofiToken`.

### GitHub Sponsor

Enables the usage of [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) as a payment service to receive donations. Only pass in your username. The button will use the following url: `https://github.com/sponsors/{your-user-name}`.
