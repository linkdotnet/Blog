## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

The blog includes some of the most important tags to get indexed by a crawler. Furthermore, some aspects of the Open Graph specification are implemented.

### Robots.txt

In the wwwroot/ you can find a default robots.txt. It allows the site gets completely indexed. If you want to tweak that behavior - feel free.
Also, you can provide a sitemap.xml to get a better ranking. The blog can create a sitemap.xml on its own. For that log in and click on the `Admin` button in the navigation bar and afterward on `Sitemap`. There you can let the blog create a new one for you. This is especially helpful after you created a new blog post to make it easier for indexers like Google.

### Open Graph Tags

To get better results when for example shared via LinkedIn some of the `<meta property="og:tag">` tags are implemented.

The following tags are set depending on the page:

| Open Graph Tag | Index                                                     | Display Blog Post                                                           |

| og:description | Short description in plain text (defined in Introduction) | Short Description of Blog Post in plain text                                |

Furthermore, the following tags are set:

| Tag                                      | Index                                | Display Blog Post             |

## RSS Feed

This blog also offers an RSS feed ([RSS 2.0 specification](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html)), which can be consumed by your users or programs like Feedly. Just append `feed.rss` to your URL or click on the RSS feed icon in the navigation bar to get the feed. The RSS feed does not expose the whole content of a given blog post but its title and short description including some other tags like preview image, publishing date and so on.
